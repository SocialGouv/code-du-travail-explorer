/*

This file is the main CSS file that imports other partial CSS files (a partial is any file with an underscore `_` preceding the name).

`postcss-cli` is used to watch the main CSS file. A flat CSS file named `bundle.css` is generated as soon as a change to any partial is made. This works thanks to `postcss-import` which inline `@import` rules content. Other PostCSS plugins are used such as `postcss-preset-env`.

- `postcss-cli`: https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli
- `postcss-import`: https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import
- `postcss-preset-env`: https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env

Before making any change to any CSS file in this project, ensure that `postcss-cli` is running with the `--watch` option, have a look at the NPM scripts to launch it easily.
